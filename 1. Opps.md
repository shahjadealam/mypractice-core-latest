Oops concepts include:

1.    Inheritance
2.    Encapsulation
3.    Polymorphism
4.    Abstraction
5.    Interface

====================================================================

Inheritance means one class can extend to another class. So that the codes can be reused from one class to another class.

Existing class is known as Super class whereas the derived class is known as a sub class.

Example:
public class Sub extends Super(){

	}

Inheritance is applicable for public and protected members only. Private members can’t be inherited.

====================================================================

Purpose of Encapsulation:
Protects the code from others.
Code maintainability.

Example:
We are declaring 'a' as an integer variable and it should not be negative.
public class Addition() {
int a=5;
}
If someone changes the exact variable as “a = -5” then it is bad.
In order to overcome the problem we need to follow the below steps:
1) We can make the variable as private or protected one.
2) Use public accessor methods such as set<property> and get<property>.
Which in turn will force others to call the setters rather than access the data directly.

====================================================================

Polymorphism means many forms.

A single object can refer the super class or sub-class depending on the reference type which is called polymorphism.

Example:
Public class Manipulation(){ //Super class
public void add(){

		}
	}
	public class Addition extends Manipulation(){ // Sub class
		public void add(){

		}
		public static void main(String args[]){
			Manipulation addition = new Addition();
			//Manipulation is reference type and Addition is reference type
			addition.add();
		}
	}
Using Manipulation reference type we can call the Addition class “add()” method. So, object shows its multiple behavior. This ability is known as Polymorphism.

Polymorphism is applicable for overriding and not for overloading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Method overriding happens if the sub class method have same
1) Method name
2) Argument type
3) Return type

The key benefit of overriding is that the Sub class can provide some specific information about that sub class type than the super class.

Public class Manipulation(){ //Super class
public void add(){

	}
}
public class Addition extends Manipulation(){ // Sub class
public void add(){

	}
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Manipulation addition = new Addition();
		//Manipulation is reference type and Addition is reference type
		addition.add();
	}
}

addition.add() method calls the add() method in the Sub class and not the parent class. So it overrides the Super class method and is known as Method Overriding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Method overloading happens for different classes or within the same class.

For method overloading, subclass method should satisfy the below conditions with the Super class method (or) methods in the same class itself:

    Same method name
    Different argument type
    May have different return types

====================================================================

An interface is a template which has only method declarations and not the method implementation.

Multiple inheritance cannot be achieved in java. To overcome this problem Interface concept is introduced.


Rules: -
1) All the methods in the interface are internally public abstract void.
2) All the variables in the interface are internally public static final that is constants.
3) Classes can implement the interface and not extends.
4) Class which implements the interface should provide an implementation for all the methods declared in the interface.

====================================================================

We can create the Abstract class by using “Abstract” keyword before the class name.

An abstract class can have both “Abstract” methods and “Non-abstract” methods.

Abstract method:
The method which has only the declaration and not the implementation is called the abstract method and it has the keyword called “abstract”. Declarations are the ends with a semicolon.

The concrete Subclass which extends the Abstract class should provide the implementation for abstract methods.

====================================================================

String:
String variables are stored in “constant string pool”.
Once the string reference changes the old value that exists in the “constant string pool”, it cannot be erased.
Example:
String name = “book”;
If the name value has changed from “book” to “pen”.
Then the older value retains in the constant string pool
(untill any other object referring it, otherwise it will be garbage collected).

String Buffer:
Here string values are stored in a stack. If the values are changed then the new value replaces the older value.
The string buffer is synchronized which is thread-safe.
Performance is slower than the String Builder.
Example:
String Buffer name =”book”;
Once the name value has been changed to “pen” then the “book” is erased in the stack.

String Builder:
This is same as String Buffer except for the String Builder which is not threaded safety that is not synchronized.
So obviously performance is fast.
Example:
String Builder name="book";

====================================================================

Abstraction:
Hiding the implementation details.
Interface is an example of Abstraction. The class which implements it, will have implemenations details but other can only see declarations in interface. For Ex:- Controller class @Autowire object of Service interface, and it does not aware about how it is implemented, it just call interface method but container will internally call implemented method of implementation class

====================================================================

Access Modifiers

[Note:
Suppose: -
1) Class A and Class B are in Package 1
2) Class c in Package 2
]

Methods and instance variables are known as members.

Public:
Public members are visible in the same package as well as the outside package (for other packages).
Public members in Class A are visible to Class B (Same package) as well as Class C (Different package).

Private:
Private members are visible in the same class only and not for other classes in the same package as well as other packages.
Private members in class A is visible only in that class. It is invisible for class  B as well as class C.


Default:
Methods and variables declared in a class without any access specifiers are called default.
Default members in Class A are visible to the other classes which are inside the package and invisible to the classes which are outside the package.
So Class A members are visible to the Class B and invisible to the Class C.

Protected:
Protected is same as Default but if a class extends then it is visible even if it is outside the package.
Class A members are visible to Class B because it is inside the package. For Class C it is invisible but if Class C extends Class A then the members are visible to the Class C even if it is outside the package.
